Platform: Udemy

# Teck stack:
Backend: Node/Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL
Test framework: Jest

# Key learning points:
1- TDD is tough like nail. Close to 80% of all the codes written is just for th tests themselves not the app itself.
2- The use of cross-env package to separate the development env from the test env. I'm still having a hard time to understand how it works behind the hood.
3- how to use winston dependency to create a basic or complex logging system that output either to the terminal or to a dedicated logging file.
